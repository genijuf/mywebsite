  <h1>Hello, this is my first website!</h1>
  <p>I love creating things for fun and learning new stuff it is really fun, but 1 bad thing is school it only slows me down and I don't learn anything valuable there so I really hate it! Also because I am bored, I am going to put 
all my info like adress and where can you contact me on this YouTube video because why not! Here's the video: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3wkyerSBpw">Link</a></p>
  <h2>This is my first website ever and it was really fun creating it!</h2>
